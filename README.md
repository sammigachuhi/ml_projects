## Prediction of health of unborn foeatuses

This machine learning project endeavours to classify the target into three classes:

1. Normal
2. Suspect
3.  Pathological

The features of the dataset are as follows:

1. baseline value - Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)

2. accelerations - Number of accelerations per second

3 fetal_movement - Number of fetal movements per second

4. uterine_contractions - Number of uterine contractions per second

5. light_decelerations - Number of LDs per second

6. severe_decelerations - Number of SDs per second

7. prolongued_decelerations - Number of PDs per second

8. abnormal_short_term_variability - Percentage of time with abnormal short term variability

9. mean_value_of_short_term_variability - Mean value of short term variability

10. percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability - Percentage of time with abnormal long term variability

The target of our ML project is the column `fetal_health` in which our classification predictions shall be performed.
